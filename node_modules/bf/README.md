# bf.js

## What does it do?

bf.js is a [brainfuck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) interpreter written in javascript/node.js.  For example,

    > var bf = require('bf')
    > bf('++++++++++[>+++++++>++++++++++>+++>+<<<<-]>++.>+.+++++++..+++.>++.<<+++++++++++++++.>.+++.------.--------.>+.>.', console.log)
    Hello World!

    > 

Cool, right?

## Why?

[Tane Piper](http://tanepiper.com/) made a joke about a 
brainfuck module for node.js, and I thought it'd be a quick project--after all,
brainfuck was designed to be easy to compile (though not particularly easy to
write)!

No, I have little interest in Actually Writing Brainfuck. :)

This is actually a second rewrite, which abandons the idea of a bf2js compiler
and simply interprets brainfuck strings. Hopefully, its more elegant and easier to
understand. Plus, it uses a newer, better prompt module!

## How do I install it?

You can just copy bf.js if you'd like, or you can use npm:

    npm install bf
